'''
SQL crtiticize client.

This client is designed to make sure that the SQL query is safe and reasonable to be executed.

It uses the already generated Vector-Database, schemaDB, which stores the schema (field) name, and the data strucutre (example)
of the field. By using the Vector-Database, it checks whether the SQL query uses correct filtering condition, including the key
words following:
    - WHERE
    - HAVING
    - ON
    - GROUP_BY

For example, if the field is in a JSON format or TEXT type, it would be less reasonable to use math operators (>=, <=, !=) for
filtering. The SQL critic should give a suggestion back to the CRICanalysisClient, helping the original client to generate a
proper SQL query instead.

Most importantly, it checks whether the SQL would modify the database or not. This can increase the safety and reliability of
the AI-agent.

The two-agent discussion workflow is like this:

Question ====> CRICanalysisClient -------> SQL query  ======> execute SQL =======> LLM =======> Answer

        You are an expert on ATLAS PanDA CRIC (Computing Resource Information Catalogue) database system.
        Your job is to review the SQL query and verify whether it is appropriate and safe to answer the user's question.

        ---
        Question from the user:
        {self.question}

        SQL query generated:
        {self.query}

        Database schema (table name, field name, data type, and examples if available):
        {field_contents_str}

        All available schema:
        {schema_list_str}
        ---

        Your tasks:

        0. **Safety check**: 
        - Verify the SQL will NOT modify the database (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER, etc.).

        1. **General question detection**:
        - If the question is **general, descriptive, or definition-like**, such as:
            - starts with “what is”, “explain”, “describe”, or “show”
            - or asks for an overview or description (not a specific dataset)
        - Then, even if the SQL query is not directly answering it, as long as it is safe and queries CRIC-related data,
            you should **approve it** by returning:
            → "True, None"

        2. **Structured data verification** (only apply if NOT a general question):
        - Check if the filtering fields in the SQL exist in the schema.
        - Verify if filtering logic and operators are reasonable based on the example data.

        3. **Flexibility**
        - CRIC schema fields such as 'region', 'countrygroup', or 'cloud' **do not represent continents or world regions**.
        They are internal ATLAS operational groupings, not geography. Therefore:
        - Do NOT expect them to filter countries by continent (like 'North America', 'Europe', 'Asia').
        - If the user question includes geographic concepts not encoded in the schema, simply approve the query.

        - If the query is syntactically correct, uses only existing fields, and is safe,
        approve it even if it does not fully match every part of the natural-language request.
          
        4. **Final output**:
        - If all checks pass → return "True, None"
        - If any check fails → return "False, ..." with reasons (no need to rewrite SQL)
